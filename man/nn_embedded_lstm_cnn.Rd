\arguments{
\item{Text}{The text that will be used as training and test data.}

\item{Codes}{The codes that will be used as outcomes to be predicted by the NN model.}

\item{Words}{The number of top words included in document feature matrixes used as training and testing data.}

\item{Seed}{The seed used in the model. Defaults to 17}

\item{Train_prop}{The proportion of the data used to train the model. The remainder is used as test data.}

\item{Epochs}{The number of epochs used in the NN model.}

\item{Batch}{The number of batches estimated in the NN.}

\item{MaxSentencelen}{All sentences will be truncated to this length to be input into the LSTM model}

\item{WordEmbedDim}{The number of word embedding dimensions to be produced by the LSTM model}

\item{ValSplit}{The validation split of the data used in the training of the LSTM model}

\item{Dropout_layer_1}{A floating variable that determines the rate at which units are dropped in the first layer of the sequential model.}

\item{Dropout_layer_2}{A floating variable bound between 0 and 1. It determines the rate at which units are dropped for the linear tranformation of the inputs.}

\item{Dropout_layer_3}{A floating variable bound between 0 and 1. It determines the fraction of the units to drop for the linear transformation of the recurrent neural network layer.}

\item{Filter}{}

\item{Kernel_size}{}

\item{Pool_size}{}

\item{Units_lstm}{The number of network nodes used in the LSTM layer}

\item{CM}{A logical variable that indicates whether a confusion matrix will be output from the function}

\item{Model}{A logical variable that indicates whether the trained model should be included in the output of this function}
